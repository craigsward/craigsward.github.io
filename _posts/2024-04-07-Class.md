**Corringham  Village Hall, Marton  Village Hall, Lea  Village Hall, West Stockwith Village Hall and Scout Hut Community Classes**  

These classes are great if you prefer to practise in a morning or evening with a larger group of like minded yogis but cannot commit to a weekly class. All of the locations have ample space but I still do require you to pre book your class so I know who to expect on the day then you can easily be notified if I ever need to cancel class.

You can pay as you go at my community classes and these are better suited to you if you know you can't commit to a weekly practise due to work/family commitments. You can also pre-book a block of four classes if you know that you are able to use the block up within 6 weeks (2 week window to account for holidays/illness). I ask you provide your own mat for hygiene reasons but also your own mat will hold your own unique energy.
To book a community class you can use the calendar in the class schedule section of my website which will take you to my Eventbrite page or you can request to join my WhatsApp group by emailing me at: yogaovyboyle@gmail.com
