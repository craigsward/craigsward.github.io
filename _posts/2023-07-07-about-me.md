I am Angela of Viking Yoga, teaching from my home studio in Lea and at village locations on the outskirts of Gainsborough. I have been teaching for over 8 years and first came to yoga 10 years ago and haven't looked back.

I offer yoga classes such as Ashtanga basics to help get you started with this dynamic fast paced practise. I also teach hatha yoga which is taken at a much steadier rate with breath work, a gentle warm up, some standing postures, seated postures and a relaxation to finish. I teach a gentle chair based yoga where we use a chair as a prop to aid with certain poses and help with balance, this class attracts a more senior age group but is also ideal if you have had an illness or injury and looking for a gentle, rehab style practise to ease you back into yoga and gentle mindful movement.
