Home Studio Classes 

If you prefer to practise in the morning with a small like minded group then my home classes may be for you. Set in a private environment you will get my full attention as I am able to observe you all easily and to check in with you regularly throughout practise. These classes are like having a private session as the class can be tailored to suit individual needs more easily. You will also find that you build up a natural bond with your fellow yogis as you will be seeing the same yogis from week to week. These classes are great if you can commit to a weekly practise. With this in mind I ask that you pre-book and pay for a block of 4 classes before you start.
What you also get is use of props, a hot drink of your choice and use of an eye pillow to help with relaxation at the end of class.
I ask you provide your own mat for hygiene reasons but also your own mat will hold your own unique energy. 
To book a block of private classes please contact Angela at: yogaovyboyle@gmail.com 


Corringham and Marton Village Hall Community Classes 
These classes are great if you prefer to practise in a morning or evening with a larger group of like minded yogis but cannot commit to a weekly class. Both Village hall's have ample space but I still do require you to pre book your class so I know who to expect on the day then you can easily be notified if I ever need to cancel class. 
You can pay as you go at my community classes and these are better suited to you if you know you can't commit to a weekly practise due to work/family commitments. You can also pre-book a block of four classes if you know that you are able to use the block up within 6 weeks (2 week window to account for holidays/illness). I ask you provide your own mat for hygiene reasons but also your own mat will hold your own unique energy.
To book a community class you can use the calendar in the class schedule section of my website which will take you to my Eventbrite page or you can request to join my WhatsApp group by emailing me at: yogaovyboyle@gmail.com
