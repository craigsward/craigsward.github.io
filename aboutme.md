I am qualified with the British School of Yoga as a Yoga Teacher, and recognised and registered with the Independent Yoga Network which I keep up to date with.

I first started yoga as an injured hobby runner (still am minus the injury). It was recommended alongside Pilates to work on the imbalances in my body. I soon fell in love with Yoga and the calming effect it had on me, i was attending two classes a week and dabbling in bits at home. My local teacher suggested I start yoga teacher training, she said she would help be my guide but the rest was up to me, she planted a seed and i finally felt i had found my calling (without sounding too cheesy). I started a home study course which required practical training with a local teacher so naturally I chose the one who planted the seed of yoga with me. I trained in the theory of yoga at home working through my assignments, reading as many books/magazines I could get my hands on. I'd find whilst working I'd be checking my co-workers posture during my shifts a sure sign the training was paying off. As for the practical side of yoga I was attending as many classes as i could per week for 6 months before becoming qualified. Also travelling down to Devon  to complete my practical training to go alongside the practical hours I had accumulated back home.
I did not go down the India route and complete my training in an intensive month for a number of reasons. I believe the path I chose to learn was the best one for me personally as I learn by taking things slowly and absorbing it all in my own time, I honestly don't think I would have felt ready to teach after a month long intensive and that's just my personal view, we are all different. Everyone finds their own way and this was mine, and even now I find i learn by taking things at my own steady pace (some would say i am a methodical bore)
Once qualified I started to find my own voice and my own way of teaching. Starting out I think you really need to find your own way and make your own mistakes and learn from them, to have time to build up your own client base and find your own tribe. The time came when I needed to leave the studio I had learned so much at and gained much confidence in my teaching. It wasn't an easy decision but I wanted to do things my own way and to do that I needed to leave. I will always be grateful for the time I spent there and grateful for that one comment that changed my life for good. We do not grow however by staying in our safe place, and i have never been afraid to do things my own way and taking the long way round or so to speak.

I have been practicing now for 8 years and have been qualified for 5 years.
I practice yoga daily, and attend workshops/immersions when I can and I am currently on another home study course to deepen my knowledge on human anatomy. I think it is important to remain a student of yoga so that my teaching will never become stagnant and to keep up to date with our ever changing world.

I like to mix it up when it comes to my classes so theres something for everyone. Sometimes we will do a traditional style yoga class and other times it might be a more functional and modern style of yoga. Each week of classes is different to keep both body and mind active. Each class finishes with a simple relaxation, finding a comfortable position to 'just be' in and relax. 

I welcome everyone to my classes and modify each pose to suit the individual, from the complete beginner to the more advanced practitioner. Yoga starts with the breath just as life does, and life mirrors yoga in many ways.
